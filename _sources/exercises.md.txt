# List of exercises

## Summary

**Motivation**:
- "Discuss with your neighbors or among all participants", 5 minutes  
   Discussion exercise. In online workshops the exercise can be performed 
   using a shared workshop document (e.g. HackMD) where the exercise text is copied to the document and learners are asked to write down their experiences. In in-person workshops learners can discuss in groups around their tables.

**Organizing your projects** 
- {ref}`an-example-project`, 5 minutes  
  This exercise is performed as a type-along. The instructor slowly and methodically goes through the steps and explains what's happening.

**Recording dependencies** 

- {ref}`different-solutions-to-specify-requirements`, 5-10 minutes  
  This exercise can be performed as a general discussion (appropriate for online workshops) or as a group discussion (in in-person workshops). For a general discussion in online workshops the instructor can either walk through the exercise or let learners write down answers in a shared document.

- {ref}`exploring-conda-environments`, 10 minutes:   
  This exercise requires learners to perform steps on their own computers. In online workshops it should be done in breakout rooms for around 10 minutes.   

**Recording computational steps**

- {ref}`snakemake-in-hpc`     
  This is left as homework for learners who are interested.
- {ref}`using-snakemake`, 10-15 minutes  
  Hands-on exercise for learners to perform in groups or in breakout rooms. The purpose is for learners to understand how Snakemake operates and develop some muscle memory.
- {ref}`snakemake-with-conda-environments`    
   This is an optional exercise for learners who finish the Snakemake 
   exercise quickly.

**Sharing code and data**

- {ref}`connecting-repositories-to-zenodo`, 15 minutes   
  Hands-on exercise for learners to do in groups or breakout rooms.
  The purpose is for learners to realize how easy it is to upload code or data to Zenodo and mint a DOI.
